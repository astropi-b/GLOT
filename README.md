# Gauribidanur radio observatory LPDA array Observation Tool (GLOT)

# Innovative Web Tool for Remote Data Acquisition and Analysis

### Customized for SKA Low-Frequency Beamforming Test Bed LPDA Array at Gauribidanur Radio Observatory

---

## Overview

With the evolution of radio astronomy, education, and training, the demand for scalable, efficient, and remote systems for data acquisition, storage, and analysis has significantly increased. This project addresses these challenges by providing a web interface tailored for a log-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) array, integral to the SKA test activities at the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory.

### Key Features:
- **Technologies**: Built using Python-based tools such as Streamlit and PyVISA.
- **SCPI Commands**: Enables seamless communication with the Data Acquisition System (DAS).
- **Remote Access**: Securely accessible via WLAN or VPN.
- **Advanced Capabilities**:
  - Manual RFI masking.
  - Transit plotting.
  - Fringe plot analysis.
- **Data Hub**: Facilitates remote data download and post-observation analysis.

### Real-World Validation:
The interface has been successfully demonstrated through a solar transit observation, validating its utility in real-world astronomical applications.
